4.0

- ldns-sign-special and ldns-3597 have been removed from this repository,
  and added to the companion repository 'ldns-dns-workbench', which is
  a fork of ldns containing all necessary changes for the workbench.
  See https://github.com/SIDN/ldns-dns-workbench
- Modified how 'broken' zones are made: the 'brokenness' is now based on the
  zone apex, not the rrtype owner; this means that in a delegation from a
  correct zone to a 'broken' zone (such as bogussig.<zone>), the delegation
  itself is now correct and valid.
- Fixed 'unknownalgorithm' issue; it is no longer bogus, but correctly
  signed with the unregistered algorithm 200 (named 'twocents' for this
  occasion)

3.0

Rewritten generator and helper scripts to be usable on VM where all servers
are hosted on 1 machine

2.0

The initial workbench was mostly generated by 1 script, and a bit
of manual setup. An advantage of that approach was that it was easy
to recreate everything, to add the initial data, and to get the system
up relatively quickly. But its 'architecture' had reached the limits
of its usefullness; every change meant everything that was generated
had to be generated again, including every derived zone, every key,
etc.

The process has now been split up into multiple parts, and most of
them are able to only update their respective elements, so the rest
can be left alone.
