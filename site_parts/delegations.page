The delegations tree is a recursively generated tree of basic (signed) delegations. All zones in this tree are only hosted on one of the servers, specificed by the name in de *first* label of the zone's apex. Every zone has delegations to zones on each of the servers. The tree is three levels of delegations deep.
</p>
<p>
Currently, all the zones are signed with RSA-SHA1, and NSEC. We could make these for other types as well, should it be requested.
